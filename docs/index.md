# Welcome to Flutter errors

Flutter Errors provides a neat way to handle exceptions for your flutter applications inspired by the [Moko errors library](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-errors).
It comes with automatic mapping between globally registered exceptions and exceptions raised while performing some actions or use cases.
This library provides automatic exception handling and automatic error displaying to a screen.

- null-safe
- typesafe
- reactive
- lifecycle aware
- lightweight
- iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, Web, Windows

!!! important
The library is open to contributions!
